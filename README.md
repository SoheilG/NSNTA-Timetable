# NSNTA-Timetable

Problem:
Timetabling for the Spring and Autumn can be tedious - captains need to be able to take into account days players arent available, everyone getting an equal number of home games and everyone getting the same number of games per season. 
This can be difficult. 

Purpose:
This app will help solve this problem accounting for everything but making it automated. 

How:
The app will take in the following variables:
- Number of players
- Dates players are not available
- How many games there are in the season

The app will then output an excel sheet that gives everyone a fair go through out the season, assigning 4 players to a game.
